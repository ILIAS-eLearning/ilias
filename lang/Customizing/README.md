# Custom Language Changes

You may change terms used in the user interface of ILIAS. To do this, use the
same format as is used in the language files in directory `/lang`. Store the
values to be overwritten in files ending with `.lang.local` and put them into
the `/lang/Customizing` directory.

```
/lang/Customizing/ilias_<lang_code>.lang.local
```
