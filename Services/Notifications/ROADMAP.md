# Roadmap

## Short Term

Atm the notification mail channel is always acitvated and not configurable via UI.
It should have its own checkbox within the notification administration.

* Get rid of time dependency in `\ILIAS\Notifications\Repository\ilNotificationOSDRepository`
  and `\ILIAS\Notifications\ilNotificationDatabaseHandler`, use `\ILIAS\Data\Clock\ClockFactory` interface instead
