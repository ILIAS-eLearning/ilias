     *     We currently lack quite a lot of UI components for describing the
     *     actual contents of the page, e.g. questions, combinations of text/table/form, etc.
     *     Until these components exist an enable us to better describe the
     *     correlations to navigations, the legacy segment is used to contain
     *     rendered HTML.
