 *   Example for rendering a vimeo video player.
 *
 * expected output: >
 *   ILIAS shows a rendered video player with a vimeo video. On the left side you will see a Start/Stop
 *   symbol, followed by a time bar and on the right side a symbol for volume control and for the the full screen.
 *   A big start symbol is shown in the middle of the start screen. Clicking the Start/Stop symbol will start playing
 *   the video. Clicking the symbol again will stop the video.
 *
 *   In addition following functions have to be tested:
 *   - The video starts playing if clicking the start/stop symbol in the middle of the image. The video stops after another click.
 *   - The sound fades or raises if the volumes gets changed by using the volume control.
 *   - Clicking the full screen icon maximizes the video player to the size of the desktop size. Clicking ESC will diminish the video player.
