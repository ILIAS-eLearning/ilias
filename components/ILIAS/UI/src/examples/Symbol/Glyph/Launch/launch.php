 *   Active:
 *   ILIAS shows a monochrome symbol on a grey background. If you move your cursor onto the symbol it's
 *   color darkens a little bit. Additionaly the cursor symbol changes it's form and indicates a linking.
 *
 *   Inactive:
 *   ILIAS shows the same symbol. But it's greyed out. Moving the cursor above the symbol will not change the presentation.
 *
 *   Highlighted:
 *   ILIAS shows the same symbol. But it's highlighted particularly. The presentation will darken if you move your cursor
 *   above the symbol. Additionally the cursor symbol will change it's form and indicates a linking.
