 *   Active:
 *   ILIAS shows a monochrome plus-in-a-circle symbol on a grey background. Moving the cursor above the symbol will darken it's
 *   color slightly. Additionally the cursor's form will change and it indicates a linking.
 *
 *   Inactive:
 *   ILIAS shows the same symbol, but it's greyed out. Moving the cursor will not change the presentation.
 *
 *   Highlighted:
 *   ILIAS shows the same symbol but it's highlighted particularly. Moving the cursor above the symbol will darken it's
 *   color slightly. Additionally the cursor's form will change and it indicates a linking.
